## 1. Project Objective

This is an end-to-end Data Analytics portfolio project focused on **workforce management, employee experience, client satisfaction, and employee retention** 
within a fictional Japan-based ALT / English-teacher dispatch company.

The goal is not simply to produce charts or SQL queries. The project demonstrates the ability to:

**Understand a business problem → work with imperfect data → validate and clean data → analyze it → communicate findings → make evidence-based recommendations.**

All data is synthetic and created for educational and portfolio purposes.

---

## 2. Business Scenario
[![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black)](docs/)

The fictional company, DaimonUpDown Education, recruits, hires, trains, and dispatches ALT and English teachers to schools and educational organizations, primarily in Tokyo and surrounding areas such as Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa.

The teacher lifecycle is:

```text
Recruitment
    ↓
Hiring
    ↓
Onboarding
    ↓
Training
    ↓
Assignment / Dispatch
    ↓
Employment
    ↓
Employee Experience
    ↓
Performance
    ↓
Retention / Turnover
    ↓
Offboarding
```

At the same time, the company needs to understand the experience of the schools and educational organizations receiving dispatched teachers.

The business wants to understand:

- workforce and assignment operations
- employee satisfaction and experience
- teacher performance
- client/school satisfaction
- assignment stability and renewal
- employee retention
- employee turnover
- operational bottlenecks

The project therefore looks at the employee side and the client side together.

A central relationship being investigated is:

**Employee Experience → Teacher Performance → Client Experience → Assignment Renewal → Retention**

This is an analytical relationship to investigate, **not a claim of causation**.

## 3. The Two Dashboards

The project has **two main dashboards**, each answering a different business problem.

### 3.1 Workforce Dashboard on Tableau
[View the Workforce Dashboard on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/j.d1004/viz/WorkforceDashboard_17872800689950/Dashboard1)

[![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-E97627?style=for-the-badge&logo=tableau&logoColor=white)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/j.d1004/viz/WorkforceDashboard_17872800689950/Dashboard1)



![Workforce Dashboard](images/workforce_dashboard.png)

The **Workforce Dashboard** focuses on the operational side of teacher assignments and dispatch.

Its purpose is to answer questions such as:

- How many employees are represented in assignment data?
- Which positions have the most assignment records?
- How are assignments distributed by status?
- What assignment outcomes are occurring?
- How do assignment outcomes change over time?
- How is the workforce distributed across clients and assignments?

The dashboard story is:

```text
Workforce Representation
        ↓
Positions
        ↓
Assignment Statuses
        ↓
Assignment Outcomes Over Time
```

The dashboard is intentionally focused on **workforce assignment operations**.

It should not be interpreted as a complete employee-retention analysis. Retention and turnover require employee-level employment and offboarding information.

The Workforce Dashboard uses assignment-level data and includes supporting information such as:

- employee information
- assignment information
- assignment status
- assignment outcomes
- position

The Tableau-ready workforce dataset is:
[Dashboard Data](dashboard/data)
```text
dashboard/data/workforce_dashboard.csv
```

Its intended grain is:

> **One row per assignment.**

---

### 3.2 Employee Retention Dashboard on Excel
[![Microsoft Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Microsoft_Excel-217346?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoftexcel&logoColor=white)](dashboard/data)
![Employee Retention Dashboard](images/employee_retention_dashboard.png)

The **Employee Retention Dashboard** focuses on the employee lifecycle and the question:

> **Why do employees stay, and why do employees leave?**

Its purpose is to examine employee-level retention and turnover patterns using information such as:

- employment history
- offboarding
- employee experience
- satisfaction
- assignments
- training
- performance
- employee feedback
- client feedback where appropriate

Business questions include:

- What is the overall employee turnover rate?
- What is the retention rate?
- Which employee groups have the highest turnover?
- Which locations have the highest turnover?
- Which positions have the highest turnover?
- How many employees leave during early tenure?
- What are the common reasons employees leave?
- Is turnover associated with assignment changes?
- Is turnover associated with training completion?
- Is turnover associated with employee satisfaction?
- Is turnover associated with client satisfaction?
- Is turnover associated with career progression?
- What percentage of departing employees complete exit interviews?
- Are former employees eligible for rehire?

The retention dashboard is therefore about the **employee lifecycle**, rather than simply counting assignments.

The Excel-ready employee_retention_dashboard dataset is:
[Dashboard Data](dashboard/data)
```text
dashboard/data/Employee_Retention_Dashboard_Excel.xlsx
```

### 3.3 How the Dashboards Fit Together

The two dashboards are complementary rather than duplicates.

| Workforce Dashboard | Employee Retention Dashboard |
|---|---|
| Assignment operations | Employee lifecycle |
| Assignment records | Employment periods |
| Positions | Retention |
| Assignment status | Turnover |
| Assignment outcomes | Tenure |
| Clients / schools | Offboarding |
| Attendance | Employee experience |
| Operational workforce view | Employee-level retention view |

Together they provide a broader business story:

<img src="/images/workforce_operations_flow.svg" alt="Workforce Operations" width="650">


The project does **not** assume that one variable causes another. The dashboards are used to identify patterns, differences, and relationships that can then be investigated further.

Its workflow is:

```text
MariaDB
   ↓
SQL joins + attendance aggregation
   ↓
TSV result
   ↓
Python standard-library CSV conversion
   ↓
dashboard/data/workforce_dashboard.csv
```

The expected grain is:

**One row per assignment.**

The script validates the query result before writing the CSV.

## 12. Analytical Workflow
![Terminal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terminal-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)
![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

The project follows:

```text
Business Problem
       ↓
Business Questions
       ↓
Company & Business Definition
       ↓
Data Model
       ↓
Synthetic Data
       ↓
Data Quality Assessment
       ↓
Data Cleaning
       ↓
Exploratory Analysis
       ↓
SQL Analysis
       ↓
Visualization
       ↓
Dashboard
       ↓
Business Insights
       ↓
Recommendations
```

The dashboards are therefore the **communication layer** of the analysis, not the starting point.

---

## 13. Data Quality
![Terminal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terminal-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)
![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

Data quality is treated as part of the analytical process.

For important issues, the project aims to document:

1. What the problem is
2. How it was detected
3. Why it matters
4. What decision was made
5. How the data was corrected or handled
6. What effect the correction had

The project preserves raw source data and separates it from dashboard-ready data.

---

## 14. Business Insights and Recommendations
![Terminal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terminal-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnubash&logoColor=white)
![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-4479A1?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)

The project is designed to move from descriptive analysis toward business decisions.

Recommendations should be based on:

**Finding → Evidence → Business Impact → Recommended Action**

The analysis should distinguish between:

- a pattern
- an association
- a possible explanation
- a proven causal relationship

The project does **not** assume that a correlation proves causation.

Potential business actions may relate to:

- recruitment
- onboarding
- training
- assignment management
- employee support
- client relationship management
- retention
- turnover reduction
- assignment renewal

---

## 15. Quick Project Summary

### The business problem

A teacher-dispatch company needs to understand both:

1. **How its workforce and assignments are operating**, and
2. **How employee experience relates to retention and turnover.**

### The solution

Build a complete analytics workflow and two focused dashboards:

**Dashboard 1 — Workforce Dashboard**

> Understand assignment and workforce operations.

**Dashboard 2 — Employee Retention Dashboard**

> Understand employee retention, turnover, and potential factors associated with employees leaving.

### Main analytical areas

Recruitment 〡 Onboarding 〡 Training 〡 Assignments 〡 Attendance 〡 Employee Experience 〡 Performance 〡 Client Experience 〡 Retention 〡 Turnover 〡 Offboarding

### Future Additional Tools

It could extend and strengthen the analysis in a future iteration:

![RStudio](https://img.shields.io/badge/RStudio-75AADB?style=for-the-badge&logo=rstudio&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-4169E1?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![AI-Assisted Analysis](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI--Assisted_Analysis-412991?style=for-the-badge&logo=openai&logoColor=white)
![PowerPoint](https://img.shields.io/badge/PowerPoint-B7472A?style=for-the-badge&logo=microsoftpowerpoint&logoColor=white)

-   **RStudio** — statistical modeling and hypothesis testing beyond what SQL/Excel easily support, for deeper analysis of retention and performance patterns
-   **PostgreSQL** — a more robust, production-style database for larger data volumes, stronger data-integrity constraints, and more advanced querying than the current setup
-   **AI-assisted analysis** — speeding up data cleaning, pattern discovery, and drafting of insights, while still requiring human review before conclusions are trusted
-   **PowerPoint** — translating dashboard findings into a stakeholder-facing narrative, since decision-makers need the "so what" and recommended actions rather than the underlying charts and queries

Adopting these tools could improve the process across several stages:
- **Data gathering** — more scalable and reliable database infrastructure
- **Data cleaning** — faster identification of quality issues at larger scale
- **Visualization** — additional statistical and exploratory visualization options
- **Insights** — more rigorous, statistically grounded conclusions rather than descriptive patterns alone
- **Communication** — clearer translation of findings into stakeholder-ready recommendations

These are potential future directions and have not been implemented in the current version of the project.
